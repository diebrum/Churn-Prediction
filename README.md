# Churn-Prediction

This file contains the instructions to use the Churn Prediction model. 

There are four files:

- app.py: Python script of the Streamlit app.

- churn.png: Image used in the app background.

- joblib_model.pkl: Random Forest model for churn prediction. 

- requirements.txt: Required libraries for app deployment.

The app deployment requires the user logs in Streamlit and connect the project to the Github repository. 

The description of the model development and the dataset used can be found in my Medium post:
